# DemocracyJukebox Project


Democracy Jukebox brings the spirit of democracy to your music listening experience. Users can Up/Down Vote songs that are added to the queue, each user can only add 1 to queue x amount of times per round. Up vote your favorite songs to move them closer to the top of the stack, but watch out -- your friends might down vote your favorite!
